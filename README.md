`paddles` is a pedagogical algorithms and data structures library that aims to
- be thoroughly tested and documented
- be easy to install, use and understand
- adhere to good Python coding practices.

`paddles` is a work in progress. It currently implements
stacks, queues, deques, bags and several sorting algorithms.

## Usage
To use `paddles`, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and enter `python -V` to get your Python's version.
   If the version is 3.10 or higher, go directly to step 3.
2. If the version is lower than 3.10 or if you get an error message
   (e.g. 'python is an unknown command'), then close the terminal and
   install the [latest Python version](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. In the same terminal as step 1, or a new one if you did step 2,
   enter `pip install paddles`.
4. To check that the library is now available, enter `python -m paddles.stack`.
   You should not get any error message.

If you have any problems during installation, please report them in the
[Q & A discussion forum](https://github.com/dsa-ou/paddles/discussions/categories/q-a).
(If you're an M269 student or tutor you can use the Technical Forum instead.)
Don't forget to indicate your operating system, your Python version,
and what you did before the problem occurred, so that we can help you more effectively.

5. Read the [documentation](https://dsa-ou.github.io/paddles) to learn how to
   use the data structures and algorithms provided by `paddles`.
